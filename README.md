# Proving *e* is a Chicken Nugget: A Mathematical Look at the Free/Reduced Lunch Program in Colorado

This project focused on performing a series of clustering tests, specifically CEPP, Besag-Newell, and Spatial Scan, in order to deteremine if there was evidence of clustering of the schools districts in Colorado that had a high percentage of students that were part of the free/reduced lunch program in Colorado. The full project report can be found [here](https://github.com/DillWithIt77/Free_Reduced_Lucnhes_Project/blob/main/Proving%20e%20is%20a%20Chicken%20Nugget_%20A%20Mathematical%20Look%20at%20the%20Free_Reduced%20Lunch%20Program%20in%20Colorado.pdf).

This project was done as part of a Spatail Data Analysis class, so no furhter work is currently being done.
